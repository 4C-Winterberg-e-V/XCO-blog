The Majlen Sunshine Race is taking place for the first time in 2023. XCO sport is finally making its way to Winterberg in the Hochsauerland sports region!

How did it come about? In 2022, it was announced that the MTB events in Solingen and Wetter would not take place. In order to support the long-standing MTB series XCO-NRW-Cup and also 3-Nations-Cup in their continued existence, some mountain bike friends decided to organise a race in Winterberg.

As Majlen Müller, one of the most successful female racers from NRW, is part of the group and her ancestors come from Winterberg, the title was an obvious choice, based on the legendary XCO race in the Vinschgau Valley, the „Marlene Südtirol Sunshine Race“. The mayor of Winterberg is himself a keen XC mountain biker and was immediately enthusiastic about the idea, naturally with the desire to continue it in subsequent years.

The short planning time resulted in the following constellation: The mountain bike event in Winterberg will be organised as part of the XCO-NRW-Cup and the 3-Nations-Cup. The elite and junior classes (m/f) will be organised in the UCI C2 category.

On Saturday there will be a short track race (XCC) in category C3 for the elite classes (m/f) as part of the international national league. For the following year, an XCO competition is planned for the national league classification.

As experienced racers are heavily involved in the organising team, you can look forward to a very challenging course, which will be set up in the Winterberg trail park and will include elements of the „German Enduro Championship“.

We look forward to seeing you at the kick-off event of the Majlen Sunshine Race. For Saturday evening, we are planning an after-race party at the Bremberg-Klause in the Winterberg ski resort, so that we can also celebrate a little. Let’s all hope that the MTB-XCO sport is on the up again!
