There have recently been confirmed cases of **African Swine Fever (ASF)** (Afrikanische Schweinepest ASP) in the South Westphalia region. ASF is a notifiable animal disease that affects wild and domestic pigs. It is **not dangerous to humans**, but it does require strict containment measures. 🐗

For official information, visit the Hochsauerland district website:

Despite the current situation, we are **continuing with the planning of Winterberg XCO**. We are in close contact with local authorities and will implement all necessary precautions to ensure a safe and successful event.

We’ll keep you updated here on the blog.

🏁 **Bottom line:** Planning is underway, and we’re looking forward to an exciting event – with respect for nature, the environment, and animal health.
